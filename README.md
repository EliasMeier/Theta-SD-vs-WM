### Preprocessing


## Setup
1. Download EEGLAB
    - in the "pop_loadset" function, disable line 117:  fprintf('pop_loadset(): loading file %s ...\n', filename); so that you can't see which file is being loaded during the randomized file cleaning

### External scripts

- For EEG: EEGLAB: https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/downloadtoolbox.php. I used version 2019_1
- For Questionnaires: EWOQ analysis: https://github.com/snipeso/EWOQ_Analysis 

### Data
As of now, the data is in the hands of the Kinderspital Zurich and Sophia Snipes. Eventually this will be made open source.

#### EEG
Raw EEG data is saved as a .eeg file of BrainVision. This gets converted early on as a .set of EEGLAB, and used as such throughout. 
EEG is recorded from a 128 Channel EGI montage at 1000 Hz. 

#### Questionnaires
Questionnaires were recoded on the custom EWOQ platform, and the answers saved as JSON. These need to be first converted to .csv to run the scripts included here.

#### Tasks
Task output is also saved as a JSON, but the scripts here will gladly convert them into a single .mat file.
