% This script plots all the tasks' change from baseline (fixation post), to
% indicate whether the change with sleep deprivation within tasks matches
% their task-specific theta.

% Predictions:
% If SHY hypothesis is true: SD increases in theta should have the
% same topography as BL theta, but with larger amplitude.
% If COMP/ALPHA hypothesis is true: both some tasks (especially WM) and all SD
% conditions should just have a frontal hotspot of theta
% If LS/N1 hypothesis is true, general frontal increase in SD, independant of
% theta in tasks.

%%% Setup data

% write little script that gathers data and normalizes it. Keep raw data
% handy.

%%% Plot data


%%% Plot participants' baselines, as a control that it's all reasonable
% spectrograms

% DTAB topographies


%%% plot BL, SD1, SD2 topographies of DTAB
