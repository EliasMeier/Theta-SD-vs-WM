% break down the match2sample task
% calculate theta power using Hilbert, plot over time/sections

% plot topography of average hilbert

% calculate 2s welch for BL, Encoding, Retention (1 & 2), Probe and get
% spectrum for Fz, Cz, O1, Pz.


% see if 1 vs 3 stim theta peak is same/different from SD theta peak

% see if topographies are comparable

% plot topography of PEAK of theta
